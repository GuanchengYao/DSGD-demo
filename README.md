# DSGD-demo
#### Distributed Stochastic Gradient Descent implemented on Databricks platform.

#### The code was run on Databricks. The spark context was used to parallel the blocks. The learning curve shows that this algorithm converges fast in only a few iterations. 
#### Imported ALS model in pyspark to make comparison with DSGD method. And the total runtime shows that DSGD uses much less than the Alternating least square method.
